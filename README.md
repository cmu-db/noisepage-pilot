# NoisePage Pilot

This repository contains the pilot components for the [NoisePage DBMS](https://noise.page/).

## Quickstart

1. Install necessary packages.
    - `pip3 -r requirements.txt`
2. List all the tasks.
    - `doit list`
3. Select and run a doit task from the task list, e.g. `doit action_recommendation`.  Task dependencies are executed automatically.

## Sample Doit Tasks

The following is a list of some relevant doit tasks and their parameters:

- Action Recommendation
    - The following task will begin picking indexes: `doit action_recommendation`.
- Behavior Modeling
    - `doit behavior_datagen` runs behavior model training data generation using TScout, Benchbase and Postgres.  Requires `sudo` permissions for TScout. Also performs training data differencing (subtracting child-plan costs).
    - `doit behavior_train` trains, evaluates, and serializes models along with their evaluations and predictions. It depends on `behavior_datagen` having been run first.
    - Configure data generation, model training, Benchbase, and Postgres in `noisepage-pilot/config/behavior`.
    - Training data differencing and model training default to using the most recent experiment data.
    - Additional behavior modeling documentation is available at `noisepage-pilot/behavior/README.md`.

## Background

- Self-Driving DBMS = Workload Forecasting + Behavior Modeling + Action Planning.
    - Workload Forecasting: `forecast` folder.
    - Modeling: WIP.
    - Action Planning: `action` folder.
    - See [^electricsheep], [^15799] for more details.
