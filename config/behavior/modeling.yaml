  # Featurize Configuration
  featurize:
    # Specifies the threshold for removing variables as highly correlated.  The default is 0.7 which
    # means variables less than -0.7 and greater than 0.7 in pearson's correlation will be candidates
    # for removal.

    # Taken from featurewiz parameter description for verbose:
    #  0: Limited output. Great for running this silently and getting fast results.
    #  1: More verbiage. Great for knowing how results were and making changes to flags in input.
    #  2: SULOV charts and output. Great for finding out what happens under the hood for SULOV method.
